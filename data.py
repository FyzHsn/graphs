         "motion of points, objects and systems of groups of objects, without "
         "reference to the  causes of motion (i.e., forces ).",

         "The study of kinematics is often referred to as the geometry of "
         "motion.",

         "Objects are in motion all around us. Everything from a tennis match "
         "to a space-probe flyby of the planet Neptune involves motion.",

         "When you are resting, your heart moves blood through your veins.",

         "Even in inanimate objects there is continuous motion in the "
         "vibrations of atoms and molecules.",

         "Interesting questions about motion can arise: how long will it "
         "take for a space probe to travel to Mars?",

         "Where will a football land if thrown at a certain angle?",

         "An understanding of motion, however, is also key to understanding "
         "other concepts in physics.",

         "An understanding of acceleration, for example, is crucial to the "
         "study of force.",

         "To describe motion, kinematics studies the trajectories of points, "
         "lines and other geometric objects, as well as their differential "
         "properties (such as velocity and acceleration).",

         "Kinematics is used in astrophysics to describe the motion of "
         "celestial bodies and systems.",

         "and in mechanical engineering, robotics and biomechanics to "
         "describe the motion of systems composed of joined parts (such as "
         "an engine, a robotic arm, or the skeleton of the human body).",

         "A formal study of physics begins with kinematics.",

         "The word kinematics comes from a Greek word kinesis meaning "
         "motion, and is related to other English words such as cinema ("
         "movies) and kinesiology (the study of human motion).",

         "Kinematic analysis is the process of measuring the kinematic "
         "quantities used to describe motion.",

         "The study of kinematics can be abstracted into purely mathematical "
         "expressions, which can be used to calculate various aspects of "
         "motion such as velocity, acceleration, displacement, time, and "
         "trajectory.",
